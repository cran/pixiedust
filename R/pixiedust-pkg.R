#' Tables So Beautifully Fine-Tuned You Will Believe It's Magic.
#' 
#' The \code{pixiedust} mission is to provide a user friendly 
#' and flexible interface by which report-quality tables may 
#' be rendered in multiple output formats.  Intially, 
#' \code{pixiedust} will support markdown, HTML, and LaTeX
#' formats, as well as methods for console output.
#' 
#' The advantage of \code{pixiedust} is that it gives you the
#' control to alter the appearance of a table by as little 
#' as one cell at a time.  This fine-tuned control gives you
#' enormous flexibility in how the final table looks with 
#' minimal pre and post processing.
#' 
#' Additionally, \code{pixiedust} is largely built on top 
#' of the \code{broom} package, allowing for simple and 
#' fast generation of tables based on analytical results.
#' 
#' The chief disadvantage of \code{pixiedust} is that it 
#' can be extremely verbose.  If you are applying many
#' customizations, you will find yourself writing a 
#' great deal of code.
