\title{Apply Functions Over `dust_list` Objects}
\usage{
pixieply(X, FUN, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{An object of class \code{dust_list}.}

\item{FUN}{A function to apply to each element of \code{X}}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to pass to \code{FUN}}
}
\description{
The \code{sprinkle} methods work with \code{dust_list} 
  objects very naturally, but medleys pose a slightly more difficult problem.
  Medleys are intended to be predefined collections of sprinkles that reduce
  the time required to format a table with a particular look and style.  
  It seems counter-productive to expect a user to define each of her or his
  medleys as a method that can work with both \code{dust} and \code{dust_list}
  objects.  \code{pixieply} is a wrapper to \code{lapply} that preserves the
  \code{dust_list} class of the object.
